# Orbital-Viewer
Create an interactive VR scene/world using the Unity game engine. 
The focus of our scene is to visualize a dynamic solar system model that can 
have bodies flung into the system to see how they alter, if at all, the stability of 
the system. The gameâ€™s primary purpose is to serve as an educational tool and 
to develop proof of concept tools for a transition of our primary CAVE method to 
the Unity engine.
